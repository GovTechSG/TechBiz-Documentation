# View activity logs

You can now view a full history of account-related actions under the new **Activity logs** section. This helps Subscription Admins better track requests and actions made on TechBiz.

## What is shown in the Activity logs

The Activity logs provide a detailed breakdown of events related to your subscription account. Each log entry includes:

- **Date and time** of the action  
- **Requestor email address**  
- **Event type** (for example, account created, resource updated)  
- **Description** of the action taken

## Types of tracked activity

Some examples of tracked actions include:

- Sending or approving an account request
- Creating a resource (for example, APEX or CFT)
- Updates made by TechBiz users

## Enhanced visibility

Each entry now also shows:

- Who initiated the action (requestor)
- Who approved the request (if applicable)

This makes it easier to trace changes and ensure proper governance across users and systems.

## How to access the logs

1. Go to the **Documentation** section of your subscription account.
2. Select the **History logs** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Activity logs** section.

You can also choose a **date range** or **filter by event type** to narrow the results.
