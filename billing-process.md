# Billing process (for agencies)

This page explains the end-to-end billing process for agency subscriptions on TechBiz, including invoice review, verification, and payment.

## Overview of the billing cycle

The billing process involves the following stages:
1. Preliminary invoice review
2. Official invoice issuance
3. Verification and payment
4. Giro and PUBBS deductions (if applicable)

Each stage involves different roles and systems.

## 1. Preliminary invoice (monthly)

Every month, the **Subscription Admin (SA)** should review the preliminary invoice on the TechBiz portal.

- Verify usage and charges for the billing period.
- If there are discrepancies, raise a service request with the TechBiz team **within 7 days** of receiving the preliminary invoice.

For more information, see [Preliminary invoice](preliminary-invoice.md).

## 2. Official invoice (quarterly)

On a quarterly basis, the **Agency Finance Admin** will receive a notification when the official invoice is available.

- The invoice is issued via the **Vendors@Gov** or **NFS** portal.
- The Finance Admin should retrieve the invoice and forward it to the **Billing Admin** for verification.

## 3. Verification and payment

The **Billing Admin** should:
- Compare the official invoice against the preliminary invoices available on the TechBiz portal.
- Confirm that all charges are accurate.

If there are discrepancies:
- Raise a service request within the **payment terms period**.

If the invoice is accurate:
- Agency finance should proceed with payment **within 30 days** from the invoice issue date.

## 4. Giro and PUBBS payments

For agencies using **Giro** or **PUBBS**:
- Payment is automatically deducted, typically around the **16th of the month**.
- The invoice is usually available for viewing **2–3 days after the deduction**.
- The **Agency Finance Admin** will be notified once the invoice is ready.
