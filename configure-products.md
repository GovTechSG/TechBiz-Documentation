# Configure products

After a [system account](create-system/#request-for-a-system-account) is [approved](create-system#obtain-approval), agencies can proceed to onboard to their subscribed [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html) products. Agencies need to provide the product configuration details in the TechBiz portal. Product teams need this information to provision resources.

## Prerequisites

- An approved system account.

- **Primary subscription admin**, **Secondary subscription admin**, or **Technical admin** of the approved system account using a [non-SE GSIB](glossary) device.

- An active TechPass account.

When a public officer [configures a product](#configure-products) in the TechBiz portal, the corresponding product team receives an email notification to provision resources. The system displays a **pending provisioning** status.

After the resources have been provisioned, the public officer is notified by email and the system status changes to **provisioned**.
