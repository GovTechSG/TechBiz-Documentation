# Configure products

To onboard to their subscribed [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html) products, agencies need to provide the product configuration details in the TechBiz portal. This information is required by the product teams to provision resources.

**Who can configure products in TechBiz?**
