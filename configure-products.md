# Configure products

After their [system account](glossary) is [approved](create-system#obtain-approval), agencies need to configure their [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html) product subscriptions. This information is required by the product teams to provision resources.

## Prerequisites

- An approved system account in TechBiz.

- **Primary subscription admin**, **Secondary subscription admin**, or **Technical admin** of the approved system account can configure products using a [non-SE GSIB](glossary) device.

To configure products

1. [Log in to TechBiz portal.](log-in-to-TechBiz-portal)

2. In **Overview**, click **View systems**. Alternatively, from the **sidebar**, click **Systems**.

3. Click on the system with an **approved** status.

4. On the **Products** tab, click **View and configure**.

5. Enter the required configuration details. This depends on the SGTS product being configured. For example, you may be required to fill in the list of repositories that need to be created. (check for Cstack)

6. Click **Submit**.

When a public officer [configures a product](#configure-products) in the TechBiz portal, the product team receives an email to provision resources. The system displays a **pending provisioning** status.

After the resources have been provisioned, the public officer receives an email notification and the system status changes to **provisioned**.
