# Create subscription account

To subscribe to GovTech products and services, agencies need to have an account in TechBiz.

A TechBiz account allows agencies to subscribe to SGTS products, add systems to the account, manage subscription plans and view billing details. An agency can have one account for multiple systems or an account for each system.

> **Note**: Agencies can opt for one account with multiple systems or multiple accounts for each system. Refer to [FAQs](faq.md) for more information.
