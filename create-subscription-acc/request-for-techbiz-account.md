# Create subscription account

To subscribe to [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html) products, agencies need to have an account in TechBiz.

A TechBiz account allows agencies to subscribe to SGTS products, add systems to the account, manage subscription plans and view billing details. An agency can have one account for multiple systems or an account for each system.

> **Note**: Agencies can opt for one account with multiple systems or multiple accounts for each system. Refer to [FAQs](faq.md) for more information.

## Free access eligibility (SHIP-HATS)

For GovTech officers eligible for free access, no license purchase is required for Jira or Confluence. However, note the following important points regarding the integration between TechBiz and SHIP-HATS:

- **TechBiz subscription requirement:** Although free access users do not need a license for Jira or Confluence, a TechBiz subscription account is still required. You must first create a TechBiz subscription account.
- **Account creation sequence:** The SHIP-HATS account can only be created after a TechBiz subscription account is in place. This sequence is essential to enable the creation of Jira or Confluence accounts.
- **SHIP-HATS namespace:** For SHIP-HATS free access, one namespace is available without having to subscribe separately.

> **Note:** Ensure that the TechBiz subscription account is active before initiating the creation of the SHIP-HATS account to avoid integration issues.

### Additional resources

- For more details on free access eligibility, refer to the [Free Access documentation](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/free-access/home).
