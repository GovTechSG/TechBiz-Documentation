# Resource terminology by product

When creating resources in TechBiz, it is important to understand how each product defines a "resource." This helps avoid confusion and ensures you use the correct naming conventions when filling in resource metadata.

Each product may use different terms to describe a resource and its type. The form labels and email templates will automatically adapt based on the selected product.

## Terminology reference

| Field | APEX | StackOps | CFT |

| Resource type | – | Deployment | – |
| Resource name | Name of organisation | Name of deployment | Name of project |
| Resource shortname | Organisation code | Deployment ID | Project ID |

> **Note**  
> The resource labels shown in the UI will change depending on the product selected.  
> For example, if “StackOps” is selected, the “Resource” field will appear as “Deployment.”
