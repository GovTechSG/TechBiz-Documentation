# Invite Users

Subscription Admin or any Public Officer (using their organisation email) can trigger TechPass account creation for Public Officers / Vendors from the TechBiz Portal itself. 

> **Benefit:** This eliminates the need for Public Officers to goto the TechPass Portal and self-sign up; or for SGTS product teams to send TechPass invitation emails to Vendors.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the [**TechBiz Portal.**](https://portal.dev.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/)
2. Click **Login with TechPass.**

3. From the Overview page **or** the left sidebar, click **Invite Users.**
