# Invite Users

Subscription Admin or any Public Officer (gov.sg emails) can trigger TechPass account creation for Public Officers / Vendors from the TechBiz Portal itself. This eliminates the need for Public Officers to goto the TechPass Portal and self-sign up; or for SGTS product teams to send TechPass invitation emails to Vendors.

To view the available invitation types:

- Login to the [**TechBiz Portal.**](https://portal.dev.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/)

- From the Overview page **or** the left sidebar, click **Invite Users.**
