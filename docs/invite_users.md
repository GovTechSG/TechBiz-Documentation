# Invite Users

The **Invite Users** module allows Public Officers to conveniently manage user access to SGTS products via the TechBiz Portal.

## Getting Started

To access SGTS products, Users require a TechPass account. The TechPass account creation process is triggered, when a User receives an invitation email.
