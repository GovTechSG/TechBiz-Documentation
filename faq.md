<summary style="font-size:20px;font-weight:bold">What is the difference between creating an account with multiple systems and creating one account per system?  </summary>

If an account has multiple systems, you can share your resources across the systems and a single invoice is generated. 

If you have more than one account, you canâ€™t share resources across these accounts and agency will be charged individually for each account.
