# Generate preliminary invoice

In TechBiz, the preliminary invoice provides an interim snapshot of billing details, offering insight before the finalisation of the bill. It now supports both **APEX** and **CFT** billing formats.

> **Important:** Raise disputes by the **14th of the month** in which you receive the invoice. Disputes raised after this date may not be processed in the same billing cycle.


## To access this information, follow these steps:

1. From the sidebar, click **Accounts**.
2. Go to the required TechBiz account.
3. Click **Billing**.
