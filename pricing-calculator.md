# Pricing calculator

The Pricing calculator in TechBiz allows subscription administrators to estimate costs by selecting products, plans, and quantities, providing a detailed breakdown before finalising subscriptions.

## When to use the pricing calculator

You may want to generate a cost estimate if you are:

1. Subscribing to Central Products  
2. Exploring Central Products  

This Pricing calculator is designed to provide you with a quick and accurate estimation of subscription costs.

> **Note:** For StackOps, you can refer to the [official pricing documentation](https://go.gov.sg/stackops-pricing).  
> For other products such as APEX and CFT, pricing details may not be publicly available. Please check the **Pricing calculator** in the [TechBiz portal](https://portal.techbiz.suite.gov.sg/) for the most up-to-date pricing.
