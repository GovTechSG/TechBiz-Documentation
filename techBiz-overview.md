# TechBiz Overview

TechBiz is a Service management tool that helps government officers discover, subscribe, and manage SGTS Services on a single console.

By integrating all SGTS Services into a single console and offering a consistent and streamlined interface for users, TechBiz overcomes the complexity of reconciling subscription plans, resource usage and invoicing data across multiple Services as more SGTS Services are rolled out across the government.
