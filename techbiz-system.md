# TechBiz system

A system allows agencies to share usage of their [Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/singapore-government-tech-stack/overview/index.html) product subscriptions which can be configured and managed individually. A system is connected to a TechBiz account. An account can have multiple systems. Refer to the [FAQ](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techbiz-documentation/faq) for more information.
