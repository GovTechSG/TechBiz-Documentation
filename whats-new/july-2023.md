## July 2023

**14 July 2023**

| Type | Change | |Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Fix**| Incorrect product display in email approval |  We have resolved an issue where an incorrect product was displayed in the email approval process after adding a new product to an account. |
|**Fix**| Rejection failure due to long remarks in email | We have resolved an issue where rejecting an account via email with more than 255 characters in the remarks section resulted in the rejection not going through. Additionally, users didn't receive an unsuccessful email notification. Now, when users provide lengthy remarks during rejection, the process will function as expected, and an appropriate email notification will be sent. |
|**Fix**| Incorrect approver name in unsuccessful approval email | We've fixed an issue where the name of the approver in the email received for an unsuccessful approval process was incorrect. |
|**Fix**| Comments not updated in approval and rejection emails | We have fixed an issue where user-provided comments during the approval or rejection of an account request were not being reflected in the corresponding email notifications sent to subscription admins. Now, any comments entered during the approval or rejection process will be included in the email notifications.|
|**Fix**| Account name handling with extra whitespaces| We have fixed an issue where adding extra whitespaces at the end of an account name resulted in an automatic addition of '.' to the account name.|
